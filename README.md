# Diabetic-Prediction

Welcome to the Diabetic-Prediction repository! This project hosts a machine learning model designed to predict whether a patient is diabetic or not based on their health parameters.

### About the Project:
This repository contains detailed information about the project, including the dataset used, methodology, and evaluation metrics. The model leverages various machine learning techniques and algorithms, with a focus on ensembling techniques to improve accuracy and robustness.

### Key Features:
- **ML Techniques:** Utilizes advanced machine learning techniques and algorithms.
- **Ensembling Techniques:** Implements ensembling methods to enhance predictive performance.
- **Health Parameters:** Takes into account various health parameters to make accurate predictions.

### How It Works:
The model analyzes health parameters such as blood sugar levels, BMI, and blood pressure to evaluate the likelihood of a patient being diabetic. Through careful analysis and training, it provides reliable predictions to assist in diagnosis and treatment planning.

### Get Involved:
